# Wordle Opener üü©
Have you ever wondered if the word you generally use to open with, in [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), has already appeared in the historical games? Well, this tool will tell you exactly that and help you to go for those sweet first and second victories which are mostly luck-based! [Try it out here](https://ashishbeck.github.io/wordle_opener/)

## Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è
This is not a tool that you can use to cheese your way into a Wordle puzzle. It's mostly there to assist you in improving your luck by providing information that is already publicly available. If you want to really cheat in this game then there are already much better ways to do so. You would ideally want to use this tool very rarely when switching playstyles.

## Why does this exist? ü§®
I was inspired to build this tool when I realised the word I use to open with (OTHER) had already appeared in a game and I was doomed to never get a single attempt win if I continued to do so. And then a friend of mine also told me about the exact same problem.
I always wanted to build a Wordle clone in Flutter as a good exercise when I first found out about it. But I never got myself around it. This was my only chance to get a shot at building the clone and that too with a different and unique functionality. I am really satisfied with how identical it looks to the original while built in a completely different framework.

## Building and Compiling üõ†Ô∏è
